// Farmer John has built a new long barn, with N (2 <= N <= 100,000) stalls. The stalls are located along a straight line at positions x1,â€¦,xN (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000).

// His C (2 <= C <= N) cows don't like this barn layout and become aggressive towards each other once put into a stall. To prevent the cows from hurting each other, FJ wants to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. What is the largest minimum distance?

// Input Format
// First line contains N and C, separated by a single space, representing the total number of stalls and number of cows respectively. The next line contains N integers containing the indexes of stalls.

// Constraints
// 2 <= N <= 100,000
// 0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000
// 2 <= C <= N

// Output Format
// Print one integer: the largest minimum distance.

// Sample Input
// 5 3
// 1 2 8 4 9
// Sample Output
// 3

// Here's how the code works:

// The function isItPossible takes three parameters: an array arr representing the positions of stalls, an integer noc representing the number of cows to be placed, and an integer mid representing the required minimum distance between the cows.

// The variables lp (last placed stall position) and cpsf (count of placed cows so far) are initialized. They start from the first stall.

// The loop iterates through the array of stall positions starting from the second stall (index 1). It calculates the distance dist between the current stall and the last placed stall.

// If the calculated distance dist is greater than or equal to the required minimum distance mid, it means a cow can be placed in the current stall while maintaining the minimum distance constraint. In this case, the count of placed cows cpsf is incremented by 1, and the last placed stall position lp is updated to the current stall position.

// After iterating through all the stalls, the function checks if the count of placed cows cpsf is greater than or equal to the required number of cows noc.

// If the count of placed cows is sufficient, the function returns true, indicating that it's possible to place the cows in such a way that the minimum distance constraint is satisfied.

// If the count of placed cows is not sufficient, the function returns false, indicating that it's not possible to place the cows while maintaining the minimum distance constraint.

// Overall, this function is used to check whether it's possible to place a specified number of cows in stalls while ensuring a minimum distance between them. It uses the concept of greedy placement, iterating through the stalls and making decisions based on the required constraints.
